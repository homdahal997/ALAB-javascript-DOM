# Arithmetic Operations on Numbers &  Cross-Country Road Trip Fuel Expense Calculator

## Arithmetic Operations on Numbers
## Overview

This program performs various arithmetic operations on a set of numbers and provides the results. It checks if the numbers are divisible by 5, determines if the first number is larger than the last, and accomplishes a specific arithmetic chain of operations.

## Problem Description

Given the following set of numbers:
- number1 = 7
- number2 = 14
- number3 = 19
- number4 = 10

The program accomplishes the following tasks:
1. Checks if all numbers are divisible by 5.
2. Checks if the first number is larger than the last.
3. Subtracts the first number from the second number.
4. Multiplies the result of subtraction by the third number.
5. Finds the remainder of dividing the result by the fourth number.

## Cross-Country Road Trip Fuel Expense Calculator
## Overview

This program calculates the fuel expenses for a cross-country road trip based on different speeds and fuel efficiencies. It considers the distance of the trip, the car's fuel efficiency at various speeds, the fuel budget, and the average cost of fuel.

## Problem Description

Imagine you are planning a cross-country road trip with a total distance of 1,500 miles. Your car has different fuel efficiencies at different speeds: 
- At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
- At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
- At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.

You have a fuel budget of $175, and the average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.

The program answers the following questions:
1. How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip at each speed?
2. Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense at each speed?
3. How long will the trip take at each speed?
4. Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which speed makes the most sense for the trip?
